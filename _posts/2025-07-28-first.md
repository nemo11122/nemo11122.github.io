## My Interests

I'm passionate about a diverse range of subjects that span both analytical and creative domains:

<br>

### Finance

**Quantitative Finance**: Mathematical models, algorithmic trading, risk management

**Qualitative Analysis**: Market psychology, fundamental analysis, investment strategies

I'm always eager to understand both the numbers and the human elements behind financial markets.

<br>

### Psychology

Understanding human behavior and decision-making processes fascinates me, especially cognitive biases and their impact on daily life.

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of psychology with other fields - especially finance and gaming.

<br>

### Coding

Programming languages and software development are core interests of mine.

I love problem-solving through code and building tools that make life easier.

<br>

### Sports

Athletic performance and strategy analysis captivate me, along with the psychology of competition.

Sports analytics and data-driven insights provide endless learning opportunities.

<br>

### Gaming

Game design and mechanics, competitive gaming strategies, and the social aspects of gaming communities all intrigue me.
